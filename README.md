International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT) actually started its journey in the year 1998. ICCIT has evolved from the National Conference on Computer and Information Systems (NCClS) which was held in 1997 at the Dhaka University, Bangladesh. Since 1998, the conference is being organized every year by different public and private universities. This is the longest running IEEE sponsored peer-reviewed conference in Bangladesh.
The 25th ICCIT 2022 will be held in hybrid mode during 17-19 December at Long Beach Hotel, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh organized by the IEEE Bangladesh Section. All researchers are encouraged to prepare for submissions at ICCIT 2022 to celebrate it’s 25th Anniversary
This year’s ICCIT is being hosted to provide a unique opportunity for the computer and information technology professionals, scientists, engineers, educators, researchers and students from all over the world to exchange their scientific ideas, views and thoughts with fellow researchers and participants. This conference addresses state-of-the-art issues and topics related to computer science and engineering and information technology.
